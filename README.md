# p5js_scripts
These are the ones I ve been playing with at the p5.js editor, so are stored here as backup (sorts of).

How to try these p5.js scripts:

1. Clone the repo (or download the files).
2. Edit the index.html where it requires the script, at the HTML script tag.
3. Open the index.html in a web browser, or in VSCode you can use Live Server on localhost.
4. Press the S key in your keyboard to run the save() function to promt a file download of a render canvas image.

At the moment is only 1 script, but I will be adding more.
